# Amar RPG Equipment and Costs

## Monetary System

The economy uses three coin types:

- **Copper (cp)**: 10g weight, 26mm diameter, 2mm thick
- **Silver (sp)**: 10g weight, 25mm diameter, 2mm thick
- **Gold (gp)**: 30g weight, 28mm diameter, 3mm thick

**Exchange Rates**:
- 1 sp = 20 cp
- 1 gp = 50 sp
- Therefore: 1 gp = 1000 cp

**Modern Value Approximation**: One silver piece ≈ €20 or $20
